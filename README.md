# 🛡️ My SOC Lab & Learning Path

The goal of this project is to **build a home lab and a series of small projects** that will help me understand how a SOC analyst works.  
I’m starting everything on a single laptop, and in the future I plan to expand the lab with a dedicated **Splunk SIEM** and an additional server/honeypot.

---

## 🖥️ Current lab setup

Right now I’m using only one laptop with three virtual machines:

- **Windows 10 Pro** – target system, traffic generation, testing.  
- **Kali Linux** – security tools (e.g., nmap, other scanners).  
- **Ubuntu Linux** – log analysis, network tools, and preparation for Splunk.

In the future I plan to add:

- A **Lenovo** machine as a dedicated **Splunk SIEM** (Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud).  
- A **computer with a Phenom CPU** as a **honeypot** or lab server.

---

## 🎯 Why I’m doing this

- To understand how a SOC analyzes logs, alerts, and incidents using **Splunk**.  
- To practically learn tools like **Wireshark, Splunk, and Nmap**.  
- To build a portfolio of projects that I can show during SOC‑analyst job interviews.  
- To learn how to document experiments, Splunk searches (SPL), and detection ideas.

## 📚 Repository structure

- `README.md` – general description of the lab and my goals.  
- `projects/` – folder for individual projects (e.g., `nmap/`, `wireshark/`, `splunk/`).  
- `docs/` – additional documentation (lab topology, Splunk setup notes, etc.).

---

## 🧰 Current projects (task list)

- [x] Build the basic lab topology on my laptop (3 VMs).  
- [x] Nmap project – understand different scan types and how they look in logs.  
- [ ] Wireshark project – analyze traffic generated by Nmap and other tests.  
- [ ] Splunk project – basic setup, data ingestion, and simple searches (SPL).  
- [ ] Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows and Linux hosts.  
- [ ] Create basic alerts and dashboards in Splunk for suspicious activity.  
- [ ] Add a honeypot/server on the Phenom‑based machine and send its logs to Splunk.

# 🎯 Project: Getting started with Splunk

## Goal
- Install and configure Splunk in the lab.  
- Ingest logs from Windows and Linux hosts.  
- Write basic SPL queries to analyze events.

## What I did
- Installed Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu (or Splunk Free).  
- Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows 10 and Ubuntu.  
- Forwarded Windows Event Logs and Linux auth logs to Splunk.  
- Created simple SPL queries to:
  - Count failed logins.  
  - Show top source IPs.  
  - Group events by host.
```
## Example SPL queries

```markdown
index=windows sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625
| stats count by _time, src_ip, user
| where count > 5
index=linux sourcetype="auth" action=failure
| stats count by host, user
```
