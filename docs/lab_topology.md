# 🖥️ Lab Topology

This document describes the current and planned network topology of my SOC lab.

---

## 🧩 Current setup (on one laptop)

All machines run as virtual machines on a single laptop.

### Hosts

- **Windows 10 Pro (VM)**  
  - Role: target system, client, and server for generating traffic.  
  - Logs: Windows Event Logs (Security, System, Application).  
  - Tools: basic networking tools, browsers, test services.

- **Kali Linux (VM)**  
  - Role: attacker / tester machine.  
  - Tools: `nmap`, `tcpdump`, other scanning and exploitation tools.  
  - Traffic: generates scans and test attacks against Windows and Ubuntu.

- **Ubuntu Linux (VM)**  
  - Role: analysis and future Splunk host.  
  - Logs: system logs, auth logs, and any custom logs generated by scripts.  
  - Tools: Wireshark, tcpdump, basic SIEM‑like analysis scripts.

### Network layout (current)

All VMs are connected to the same internal virtual network (e.g., `VMnet2` in VirtualBox / VMware).  
- Each VM has a static or DHCP IP in the same subnet (e.g., `192.168.56.0/24`).  
- The laptop host is used only as the hypervisor; no services are exposed directly from it.

## 🚀 Planned expansion

### Splunk SIEM (Lenovo machine)

- **Lenovo (physical)**  
  - Role: dedicated Splunk SIEM server.  
  - Components:
    - Splunk Enterprise (or Splunk Free).  
    - Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows and Ubuntu.  
  - Data flow:
    - Windows Event Logs and Ubuntu auth/logs → Splunk via Universal Forwarder.  
    - Future: Kali logs, honeypot logs, and other sources.

### Honeypot / Server (Phenom‑based machine)

- **Phenom‑based computer (physical)**  
  - Role: honeypot or lab server.  
  - Options:
    - Simple web server with vulnerable services to attract scans.  
    - SSH honeypot or other open‑source honeypot software.  
  - Logs:
    - All activity will be forwarded to Splunk for analysis.

## 📡 High‑level data flow

1. Kali scans Windows and Ubuntu.  
2. Wireshark captures traffic on Ubuntu or Windows.  
3. Logs from Windows, Ubuntu, and the honeypot are sent to Splunk.  
4. Splunk is used to:
   - Search and correlate events.  
   - Create alerts for suspicious activity (e.g., brute‑force, unusual scans).  
   - Build dashboards for monitoring the lab.
